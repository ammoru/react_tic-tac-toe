Tic-Tac-Toe React App



This project is a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and powered by Vite for a fast and efficient development experience.

🚀 Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create Vite Project using the React SWC template:

npm create vite@latest tic-tac-toe-react-app --template react-swc

📜 Available Scripts

In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the vite binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly using npx vite.

🔹 npm run dev

Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

🔹 npm run build

Builds the app for production to the dist folder.

React is bundled in production mode and optimized for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for better caching.

The app is ready for deployment!

For more details, check out the Vite Deployment Guide.

🔹 npm run preview

Locally preview the production build.

After building the app using npm run build, preview it locally by running:

npm run preview

This will serve the static files from dist at http://localhost:4173.

A great way to verify the production build before deploying!
